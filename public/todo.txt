2. update react map to fit design of static map
    - map bg
    - map icons
    - highlight icons 
3. change cards to expand on small browser -- created expandable card, not implemented to accomodate screen size
4. center cards -- DONE 
5. change divider color -- DONE 
6. update profile cards
    - add outline to photos
    - instead of expanding, have text appear as an overlay over the card -- due to layout/size concerns

8. reduce padding/spacing between title and subtitle in headerMainContent (& reduce size of text slightly?)
9. potentially change the background color of about section? ~ added breakline
